During the weekend I spent time with a friend. We talked at length about work and life in general.

One idea that really stood out was **Death Ground**—the notion that while war is terrible for people, it often accelerates progress for nations because it forces rapid innovation and adaptation in ways peace rarely does.

The story of Hernán Cortés illustrates this idea well. As narrated by ChatGPT:

> In 1519, Cortés landed on the coast of what is now Mexico with a small force of men. He was officially meant to explore and trade, but he had bigger ambitions. To prevent his men from retreating or deserting, he scuttled or burned the ships they arrived in—accounts differ on the details, but the message was unmistakable: there was no retreat.

> With his men fully committed, Cortés marched inland, formed alliances with indigenous groups hostile to the Aztecs, and eventually reached Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital. Through a mix of diplomacy, warfare, and the devastating effects of European diseases, he toppled the Aztec Empire by 1521.

> Burning the ships became a legendary symbol of total commitment—no turning back, and embracing risk in pursuit of ambition.

This is just one of many similar stories from history across the world.

I’m not suggesting that countries should go to war more. But when applied to individual life, this idea matters deeply.

In the past few months, I’ve learned more about life—and about myself—than in all my years combined. I’ve discovered my strengths, but more importantly, I’ve confronted just how weak I can be.

I’ve had to learn life lessons faster than ever because I was forced to face reality head-on. I’ve been on death ground. As an avid reader, I’ve come to realize that a single lived experience can teach more than a hundred books ever could.

The fastest way to learn is to step into the arena.

This process has been humbling. I’d like to say it has been rewarding too, but I’m still on death ground—so I hope it will be. What I know for certain is this: I intend to keep stepping into the arena and continually seek feedback from reality.
