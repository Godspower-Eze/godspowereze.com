## Hi, I'm Godspower

I am an independent researcher and engineer exploring the power of **lattice-based cryptography**.

I have great conviction in the value of research and exploration based on **beauty**. This helps you consistently ask **why** without the pressure of a goal. Although it might not be obvious, this is how truly groundbreaking works are created.

This is even more true in the field of **lattice-based cryptography**, which is a top candidate for **post-quantum cryptography** and its other applications, such as **Fully Homomorphic encryption(FHE)** and **Indistinguishability obfuscation(IO)**.

While on this search for beauty, I **write deep articles** and **build tools**.

<!-- I am committed to this goal for the foreseeable future and would love your support on this journey. -->

## Notable Works

### Current

- <a href="/tags/lattices/" target="_blank">A Deep Dive on Lattice-Based Cryptography</a> - a series that takes you from zero to one in lattice-based cryptography. It aims to close the learning gap between "what is a lattice?" and how lattice-based cryptography is used in **Fully homomorphic encryption(FHE)** and **Indistinguishability obfuscation(IO)**.
- <a href="https://github.com/Godspower-Eze/ml-kem.rs" target="_blank">ml-kem.rs</a> - a rust library for **ML-KEM(Module Lattice Key Encryption Mechanism)**

### Previous

- <a href="https://www.modcc.xyz/" target="_blank">modcc.xyz</a>  - a tool for the sumcheck protocol. It computes **univariate lagrange interpolation over finite field**, **multilinear interpolation over the boolean hypercube** and **multivariate lagrange interpolation over finite field**.(Watch <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/4e2e53047b2542d4b79fc0fb10d7f66e?sid=6c2f7566-2675-49c2-82a1-0edf7ad2dc76" target="_blank"> demo</a>)
- <a href="https://github.com/Godspower-Eze/learn-cryptography-and-zk" target="_blank">learn-cryptography-and-zk</a> - A collection of cryptographic and zero-knowledge algorithms explained simply and implemented from scratch in Python and Rust
- <a href="https://github.com/Godspower-Eze/notes-on-ZK-and-Complexity-Theory" target="_blank">notes-on-ZK-and-Complexity-Theory</a> - A deep dive into the Sumcheck Protocol and some complexity theory.

>It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.<br><br>
